# hello-world
Just another repository
Hi I'm Ben Johnson and I am just learning this git repository stuff. 
It seems to be the number one authority for coding projects.
I like the look and feel so far so turn me into a believer.

## New Learning

After a few years I've decided to really try to understand git at a higher level.
This is my first attempt to do some stuff on my own with it. 

### Using the other source control

This should be simpler. We will see.
